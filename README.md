**100% Local & Private** — Your credentials and messages and all other data related to your account are stored locally on your PC.
**Personality Cloning** — AI that actually sounds like you  
**Auto-Pilot Mode** — Let Raiden handle conversations automatically  
**Suggestion Mode** — Review AI drafts before sending  
**AI Assistant** — Search your DMs with natural language

### 100% Private & Local
Raiden runs on your machine. Your credentials and messages never leave your device.

Ask Raiden anything: "What do I say to aslan?" or "Does Sarah seem interested?". It's a search engine for your social life.
